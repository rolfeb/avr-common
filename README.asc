This is my small library of utilities for AVR microcontroller development.

== build
This directory contains Makefile snippets to abstract out a lot of common
building stuff. I generally build my software using the following tools:

.Bulleted
* *avr-gcc* for compiling
* *avrdude* to control the programmer
* AVR *JTAGICE3* programmer

There are a set of microcontroller-specific files; these contain a few
parameters that are specific to each chip.

To use the build files, you just need to add the following two lines to the
top of your project Makefile:

[source,Makefile]
----
AVR_ROOT        =       ../../avr-common
MCU             =       <insert-microcontroller-type>
----

At the end of the Makefile, add the following:

[source,Makefile]
----
include $(AVR_ROOT)/build/avr-build.mk
----

== modules
Some modules to support various bits of hardware etc. To add one of these to
a project, you need to add it to the +MODULES+ definition in the Makefile,
for example:

[source,Makefile]
----
MODULES         =       ds1820
----

You'll also need to include the corresponding header file (e.g. +ds1820.h+)
in the source file[s] that uses the module.

== include
Some useful common include files. Also contains the header files for various
modules.
